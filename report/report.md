# Report for assignment 4

## Project

Name: TheAlgorithms/Python

URL: [TheAlgorithms/Python](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Python)

A collection of common algorithms implemented in Python for educational purposes.


## Selected issue(s)

Title: Adopt a more robust testing system \#309

URL: [#309](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Python/issues/309)

The current tests are incoherent and very limited in capability. There are few tests with each algorithm. Refactor into a more robust testing system.

## Onboarding experience

Did it build as documented?
    
(See the assignment for details; if everything works out of the box,
there is no need to write much here.)

## Requirements affected by functionality being refactored

## Existing test cases relating to refactored code

## The refactoring carried out

(Link to) a UML diagram and its description

## Test logs

Overall results with link to a copy of the logs (before/after refactoring).

The refactoring itself is documented by the git log.

## Effort spent

For each team member, how much time was spent in

1. plenary discussions/meetings;

2. discussions within parts of the group;

3. reading documentation;

4. configuration;

5. analyzing code/output;
